                  <h2>Jorge Ruiz</h2>
                </p>
                <p>I'm an International Student at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/">York University</a> in Toronto, where I study a major in <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/sas/bcom/">Business Commerce</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was born in the US, but I feel like I was born in <a href="https://visitguadalajara.com/">Guadalajara, Jalisco</a>, which is a big city in Mexico. As a fact, I think Mexico is not well-recognized as the <a href="https://visitmexico.com/eng/home-2">incredible country</a> it is, feel free to check it out! I am also a big <a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/faq/all-you-need-to-know-about-soccer">soccer</a> fan, the most popular sport in the world, hopefully you will get to know more about it throughtout my website.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT3O93-nxDc">Music</a> is one of my favorite hobbies as well. Whenever I'm feeling down, it's my go-to source of comfort. And when things are going well, it just makes everything even better! There's something about the beat and rhythm that gets me in a good mood, and I love how it can express any emotion you're feeling.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcFFwK4ot1k">Music</a> is a form of art that uses sound organized in time. It encompasses various elements such as melody, harmony, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and timbre to evoke emotions, convey ideas, and communicate messages. Music can be created using voices, musical instruments, or electronic devices, and it can range from simple melodies to complex compositions.
