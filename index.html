                  <h2>Jorge Ruiz</h2>
                </p>
                <p>I'm an International Student at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/">York University</a> in Toronto, where I study a major in <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/sas/bcom/">Business Commerce</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was born in the US, but I feel like I was born in <a href="https://visitguadalajara.com/">Guadalajara, Jalisco</a>, which is a big city in Mexico. As a fact, I think Mexico is not well-recognized as the <a href="https://visitmexico.com/eng/home-2">incredible country</a> it is, feel free to check it out! I am also a big <a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/faq/all-you-need-to-know-about-soccer">soccer</a> fan, the most popular sport in the world, hopefully you will get to know more about it throughtout my website.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT3O93-nxDc">Music</a> is one of my favorite hobbies as well. Whenever I'm feeling down, it's my go-to source of comfort. And when things are going well, it just makes everything even better! There's something about the beat and rhythm that gets me in a good mood, and I love how it can express any emotion you're feeling.
